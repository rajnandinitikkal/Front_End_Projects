                <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                <p>The 90th birth anniversary of the former president of India, <b>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam</b> was observed on 15th October in India. Dr. Kalam was a renowned scientist also known as the Missile Man of India. Read here to know more about his
                    life and achievements. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was elected as India's 11th president from 2002-2007 and died in 2015 while he was delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong at the age of 84. The birth anniversary
                    of Dr. Kalam is celebrated as National Innovation Day and World Students Day. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency,
                    and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School in Ramanathapuram, Kalam continued his education at Saint Joseph's College in Tiruchirappalli, which was formerly a part of
                    the University of Madras. He earned a physics degree from this institution in 1954, and he moved to Madras in 1955 to pursue a degree in aerospace engineering there. He came in ninth in the qualifiers, and there were only eight seats
                    available in the Indian Air Force, thus he simply missed realizing his dream of becoming a fighter pilot.
